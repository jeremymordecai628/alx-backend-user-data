**Here's a breakdown of the learning objectives:**

### General Concepts:

1. **Authentication:**
   - The process of verifying a user's identity.
   - Involves checking credentials like usernames, passwords, or other security tokens.
   - Ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources or functionalities.

2. **Session Authentication:**
   - A technique where a server-side session is created to track a user's activity.
   - A unique session ID is assigned to the user and stored in a cookie or passed in the URL.
   - Subsequent requests from the user include the session ID, allowing the server to identify the user and maintain their session state.

3. **Cookies:**
   - Small text files stored on a user's computer by a web browser.
   - Used to store information about the user's session, preferences, or other data.
   - Can be used to track user behavior, personalize content, and maintain user sessions.

### Technical Skills:

1. **Sending Cookies:**
   - Using appropriate HTTP headers (e.g., `Set-Cookie`) to send cookies with a response.
   - Setting cookie attributes like expiration time, domain, and path.
   - Ensuring secure cookie transmission by using HTTPS and appropriate security flags.

2. **Parsing Cookies:**
   - Extracting cookie information from the `Cookie` header in a request.
   - Decoding and interpreting cookie values.
   - Validating cookie integrity and security.

By understanding these concepts and mastering the technical skills, you can effectively implement authentication and session management in web applications.
