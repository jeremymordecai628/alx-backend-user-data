Here's a quick breakdown of the key learning objectives:

### 1. **What authentication means**
   - **Authentication** is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It confirms whether someone or something is who they claim to be. Common methods include passwords, biometric verification, and multi-factor authentication.

### 2. **What Base64 is**
   - **Base64** is an encoding method used to convert binary data (like images or text) into an ASCII string format. It represents binary data in a text format using only 64 characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, and /), making it useful for transmitting data over media that only support text.

### 3. **How to encode a string in Base64**
   - To encode a string in Base64:
     - Use a Base64 library in your preferred programming language.
     - For example, in Python:
       ```python
       import base64
       encoded_string = base64.b64encode("your_string".encode()).decode()
       ```
     - This transforms `"your_string"` into a Base64 encoded format.

### 4. **What Basic authentication means**
   - **Basic Authentication** is a simple HTTP authentication method where the client sends a username and password, encoded in Base64, to the server. The credentials are included in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request.

### 5. **How to send the Authorization header**
   - The **Authorization header** is used in HTTP requests to send authentication credentials.
   - The format for Basic Authentication is: `Authorization: Basic <Base64_encoded_credentials>`
   - For example, in Python:
     ```python
     import base64
     import requests

     credentials = "username:password"
     encoded_credentials = base64.b64encode(credentials.encode()).decode()
     headers = {"Authorization": f"Basic {encoded_credentials}"}
     response = requests.get("http://example.com", headers=headers)
     ```
   - This sends the encoded credentials in the request header to authenticate with the server.
